Programming Experience: Worked with python as a hobby for a summer and for classes, Understand some of the basics of Java


9th Grade Year: In the space below, write 2-5 sentences describing your programming experience in the previous year, even if you went to another school.

We did a different projects that taught us the core mechanics of python and ways of storing information. This involved making a text based game and a magic 8 ball. This
was done in preparation for the AP computer science test. 


10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).


We worked with python to make a program that simulates shuffling and dealing a deck of cards and understanding abstraction. This was done by working with pseudo code and
converting things to binary.  I also worked with html to create a vr space however that didn't get very far. This was also done in preparation for the AP test however it can
be applied to other things with our lives and not just computer code.


What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?


I would like to improve on thinking ahead and being able to check my work in a more time efficient way.


What is one part of programming or this class that you feel like challenges you more than others?


Not nitpicking my work and generally getting things done is a big challenge for me. Also spelling things right and consistently.


What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.


Currently my goal is to pass the AP exam but I haven't thought much farther than that.
